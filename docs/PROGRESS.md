# Pocket Arena 8 — progress log

Newest first. Claude appends: date · what changed · how to try it on a phone · open questions.

## 2026-11-10 · Serpent Grid ready for closed testing (branch serpent-grid-v1)
- Godot 4.7.2 project, core services (Rng, SaveService, Settings, Audio, Economy, GameRegistry, SceneRouter, Boot args),
  hub with 8 manifest-driven cards (only Serpent Grid enabled), daily challenge, coins.
- Serpent Grid: pure logic + CPU rival (BFS to orb + flood-fill trap check) + neon 3D view + HUD. 30 headless tests.
- Verified on a Vivo V2250 (Android 15): hub → game → swipes → crash/result → rematch.
- Release: Gradle AAB (minSdk 24, targetSdk 36), scripts/make_upload_key.sh + scripts/build_release.sh,
  store assets + listing + privacy policy in docs/store/, CI workflow (not yet run on GitHub).
- Try it on a phone: `godot --headless --path . --export-debug "Android APK" build/pa8.apk && adb install -r build/pa8.apk`.
- Dev shortcuts: `godot --path . -- --game=snake --bot --difficulty=hard` (bot runs never touch the save).
- Open: gdUnit4 is 6.2.3 (guide said v7, which doesn't exist); tests need --headless --ignoreHeadlessMode.
